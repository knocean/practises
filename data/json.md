## Limitations

JSON is painfully limited.
No comments.
No sets.
Poor numerics.
Keys must be strings.
Gotchas like "no trailing commas".
Important tooling still being built.

Its limitations are really the key to its success.
Every programming language has sequences and maps,
even if they don't have sets.
Every programming language allows keys to be strings,
even if they don't allow anything else.
JSON is the lowest common denominator
for data structures in any programming language,
so it's almost always pretty easy to just load JSON
as native data structures.

"Things should be as simple as possible..."
Well, JSON is not quite as simple as it could be for what it does,
but it's pretty darn simple.
For a lot of simple tasks,
JSON hits the sweetspot.
The problem comes with the rest of that quotation:
"... but no simpler."
When we do need more from our data language,
the limitations of JSON become painfully apparent.
