# SQL

The [Structured Query Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL)
might as well be called the "Standard Query Language"
becuase it is nearly synonymous with databases.
While there are many variations on SQL
we mostly care about two gold-standard open source implementations:
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) and
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org).

## SQLite

SQLite is an embedded SQL database,
so everything is contained in a single file.
I love it for development workflows
where I can delete and rebuild the database
without worrying about stale data or permissions.
The datatypes are very basic but sufficient for many tasks.
There are nice bindings to every language,
making it much faster than Python code.

## Postgres

Postgres is a database server.
You kind of need to set it up and manage it,
although it's possible to use a throwaway Docker container.
Postgres is much more powerful and complex than SQLite,
but most of the time I don't need the extra power.

## SQLAlchemy

[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a Python SQL toolkit and object-relational mapper (ORM).
Many people avoid ORMs because of the
[Impedance Mismatch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_impedance_mismatch) problem,
or because they prefer to avoid Object Oriented programming.
SQLA can be used independent of the ORM,
and if the ORM is used it can be done in a lightweight way.
