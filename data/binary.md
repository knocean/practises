# Binary

For completeness, we should start with binary.
Nearly all the computers ever made store information in binary.

Why binary?
Because it's relatively easy to make a machine
(such as a transistor)
that can be in one of two states,
and then connect those little machines into larger logical circuits
so that information can flow through them
in predictable ways.
I say *relatively* easy:
it's actually a stunning accomplishment!
The history of early computing is fascinating.
I'm just trying to say that
binary turns out to be a lot simpler for building machines
than the base-10 numbers we're more familiar with,
or trinary,
or all the other things that have been tried.

So at bottom, all our data is represented as sequences of 1s and 0s.
Except for programmers,
most people never have to think about
the binary representation of their data.
